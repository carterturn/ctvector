ctvector
========

CTVector is part of the Terca C++ libraries.
It provides a very basic 3 (or 2 or 1) dimensional
vector class. This is designed to be used with
OpenGL (in fact, it has a built-in draw
function).
I have found myself using this frequently
enough that I decided to turn it into a
library that I could access easily.

Installing
==========

This library uses a standard makefile.
Note that if you are not on a GNU/Linux
system, you will probably need to change
the install directories. You may also
need to change the compiler. The default
is gcc.
To build and install use:

make
sudo make install
